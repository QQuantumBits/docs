# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with LilChunks chunk pregeneration in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through your first pregeneration task.

<Note>
This guide assumes you have already [installed LilChunks](/lilchunks/installation) on your server.
</Note>

## Your First Pregeneration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join Your Server">
    Connect to your Minecraft server and navigate to the area where you want to pregenerate chunks.
    
    <Tip>
    Choose a central location like spawn or a main base area for your first pregeneration.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Pregeneration">
    Use the start command to begin chunk generation around your current location:
    
    ```bash
    /lilchunks start 10
    ```
    
    This will pregenerate chunks in a 10-chunk radius around your position.
    
    <Info>
    **Chunk Radius Explained**: A radius of 10 means chunks will be generated 10 chunks in each direction from your position, creating a 21x21 chunk area (441 total chunks).
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Check the generation status to see progress:
    
    ```bash
    /lilchunks status
    ```
    
    You'll see output like:
    ```
    Generation Status for world:
    » Status: Running
    » Progress: 156/441 chunks
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for Completion">
    Let the pregeneration complete. You can continue playing while it runs in the background.
    
    <Warning>
    Avoid stopping the server during pregeneration unless necessary. Use `/lilchunks stop` first.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Command Aliases

LilChunks provides convenient aliases for faster command execution:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Full Commands">
    ```bash
    /lilchunks start 10
    /lilchunks status
    /lilchunks stop
    /lilchunks reload
    /lilchunks help
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Short Alias (/lc)">
    ```bash
    /lc start 10
    /lc status
    /lc stop
    /lc reload
    /lc help
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Alternative (/chunks)">
    ```bash
    /chunks start 10
    /chunks status
    /chunks stop
    /chunks reload
    /chunks help
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Pregeneration Scenarios

### Small Area (Spawn Protection)
Perfect for spawn areas and small bases:

```bash
# 5 chunk radius (11x11 chunks = 121 total)
/lc start 5
```

### Medium Area (Town/Base)
Good for larger bases and town areas:

```bash
# 15 chunk radius (31x31 chunks = 961 total)
/lc start 15
```

### Large Area (World Border)
For major world areas or world borders:

```bash
# 50 chunk radius (101x101 chunks = 10,201 total)
/lc start 50
```

<Warning>
Large pregeneration tasks can take significant time and server resources. Start small and monitor performance.
</Warning>

## Understanding the Output

When you start pregeneration, you'll see colorful status messages:

### Successful Start
```
✓ Started chunk generation in a 10 chunk radius.
```

### Status Check
```
Generation Status for world:
» Status: Running
» Progress: 156/441 chunks
» Estimated Time: 2m 30s
```

### Completion
```
✓ Chunk generation completed for world: world
» Total chunks generated: 441
» Time taken: 3m 45s
```

## Managing Multiple Worlds

LilChunks can handle pregeneration in different worlds:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Current World">
    ```bash
    # Pregenerate in your current world
    /lc start 10
    /lc status
    /lc stop
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specific World">
    ```bash
    # From console, specify world name
    lc start 10 world_nether
    lc status world_nether
    lc stop world_nether
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
When using commands from the console, you must specify the world name for stop and status commands.
</Note>

## Performance Monitoring

### Check Server Performance
Monitor your server's performance during pregeneration:

```bash
# Check TPS
/tps

# Check memory usage
/memory

# Check LilChunks status
/lc status
```

### Adjust Generation Speed
If pregeneration is causing lag, you can adjust the speed in the configuration:

```yaml
chunk-generation:
  chunks-per-tick: 2  # Reduce from default 4
```

Then reload the configuration:
```bash
/lc reload
```

## Stopping Pregeneration

### Graceful Stop
Always stop pregeneration gracefully when possible:

```bash
/lc stop
```

### Emergency Stop
If the server is unresponsive, you can stop from console:

```bash
lc stop world_name
```

### Before Server Restart
Always stop pregeneration before restarting your server:

```bash
/lc stop
/stop
```

## Tab Completion

LilChunks provides smart tab completion for all commands:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Commands">
    ```bash
    /lc <TAB>
    # Shows: start, stop, status, reload, help
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Radius Values">
    ```bash
    /lc start <TAB>
    # Shows: 5, 10, 20, 50
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="World Names">
    ```bash
    /lc stop <TAB>
    # Shows: world, world_nether, world_the_end
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="🎯 Start Small" icon="target">
    Begin with small radius values (5-10 chunks) to test performance and understand the impact on your server.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="⏰ Off-Peak Hours" icon="clock">
    Run large pregeneration tasks during off-peak hours when fewer players are online.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="📊 Monitor Performance" icon="chart-line">
    Keep an eye on TPS and memory usage during pregeneration. Stop if performance degrades significantly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="💾 Backup First" icon="floppy-disk">
    Always backup your world before running large pregeneration tasks.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="🔄 Gradual Expansion" icon="arrows-rotate">
    For very large areas, consider multiple smaller pregeneration sessions rather than one massive task.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting Quick Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command Not Found" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Problem**: `/lilchunks` command not recognized
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Check if LilChunks is installed: `/plugins`
    - Verify permissions: `/lp user <name> permission check lilchunks.use`
    - Try aliases: `/lc` or `/chunks`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission Denied" icon="lock">
    **Problem**: "You don't have permission to use this command"
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Grant permissions: `/lp user <name> permission set lilchunks.admin true`
    - Use OP: `/op <username>`
    - Check permission plugin configuration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Generation Won't Start" icon="play">
    **Problem**: "Failed to start chunk generation"
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Check if generation is already running: `/lc status`
    - Verify world is loaded and accessible
    - Check server logs for error messages
    - Try a smaller radius first
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Server Lag" icon="hourglass">
    **Problem**: Server becomes laggy during pregeneration
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Reduce `chunks-per-tick` in config
    - Stop current generation: `/lc stop`
    - Use smaller radius values
    - Run during off-peak hours
  </Accordion>
