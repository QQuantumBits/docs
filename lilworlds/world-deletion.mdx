## Deletion Commands

### Basic Deletion

```bash
# Delete a world (requires confirmation)
/world remove myworld

# Alternative command
/world delete myworld
```

### Advanced Deletion Options

```bash
# Force deletion without confirmation (admin only)
/world remove myworld --force

# Delete with backup creation first
/world remove myworld --backup

# Delete multiple worlds
/world remove world1 world2 world3

# Delete with specific reason logging
/world remove myworld --reason "No longer needed"
```

## Configuration Purging Details

### Main Configuration (config.yml)

The deletion process removes world references from:

```yaml
# Before deletion
inventory-groups:
  survival:
    - world
    - myworld        # ← This will be removed
    - world_nether
  creative:
    - creative_world
    - myworld        # ← This will also be removed

world-groups:
  main:
    - world
    - myworld        # ← Removed from here too

# After deletion - myworld completely removed
inventory-groups:
  survival:
    - world
    - world_nether
  creative:
    - creative_world

world-groups:
  main:
    - world
```

### World Configuration (worlds.yml)

Complete world entry removal:

```yaml
# Before deletion
worlds:
  world:
    environment: NORMAL
    generator: null
  myworld:              # ← Entire section removed
    environment: NORMAL
    generator: VoidGenerator
    settings:
      pvp: true
      difficulty: NORMAL
  other_world:
    environment: NETHER

# After deletion
worlds:
  world:
    environment: NORMAL
    generator: null
  other_world:
    environment: NETHER
```

### Inventory Group Cleanup

Automatic cleanup of empty groups:

```yaml
# If a group becomes empty after world removal
inventory-groups:
  survival:
    - world
  empty-group: []       # ← This group will be removed

# After cleanup
inventory-groups:
  survival:
    - world
  # empty-group removed automatically
```

## Safety Features

### Confirmation System

LilWorlds requires explicit confirmation for deletion:

<Accordion title="Confirmation Message Example">
```
⚠️  WARNING: World Deletion ⚠️

You are about to delete world 'myworld'.

This action will:
✗ Permanently delete all world files
✗ Remove all configuration entries
✗ Remove from inventory groups: survival, creative
✗ Purge all world-specific settings
✗ Move 3 online players to spawn

This action CANNOT be undone!

Type '/world remove myworld' again to confirm deletion.
```
</Accordion>

### Player Protection

Before deletion, all players are safely evacuated:

```bash
# Players are automatically moved to spawn
[INFO] Moving player 'Steve' from 'myworld' to spawn world
[INFO] Moving player 'Alex' from 'myworld' to spawn world
[INFO] All players evacuated from 'myworld'
```

### Backup Integration

Optional automatic backup before deletion:

```yaml
# config.yml
deletion:
  auto-backup: true
  backup-location: "backups/"
  keep-backups: 5
```

## Deletion Logging

### Comprehensive Logging

All deletion operations are thoroughly logged:

```
[INFO] [LilWorlds] World deletion initiated: myworld (by PlayerName)
[INFO] [LilWorlds] Evacuating 3 players from world 'myworld'
[INFO] [LilWorlds] Unloading world 'myworld'

```

### Security Logging

Security events are logged separately:

```yaml
# config.yml
security:
  log-security-events: true
  log-deletions: true
  log-file: "logs/lilworlds-security.log"
```

## Recovery Options

### Backup Recovery

If you have backups, you can recover deleted worlds:

```bash
# Restore from backup
/world restore myworld_backup_20240612

# Import backup as new world
/world import myworld_backup_20240612 myworld_restored
```

### Configuration Recovery

Manually restore configuration entries if needed:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop Server">
    Safely stop your Minecraft server
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restore Config Files">
    Replace config files with backup versions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restore World Files">
    Copy world folder back to server directory
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Server">
    Start server and verify world is accessible
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bulk Deletion

### Multiple World Deletion

Delete multiple worlds efficiently:

```bash
# Delete multiple worlds
/world remove world1 world2 world3

# Delete by pattern (admin only)
/world remove --pattern "temp_*"

# Delete all unloaded worlds
/world remove --unloaded
```

### Cleanup Operations

Remove orphaned or unused worlds:

```bash
# Clean up orphaned worlds
/worlds cleanup --orphaned

# Remove worlds not accessed in 30 days
/worlds cleanup --unused 30d

# Interactive cleanup mode
/worlds cleanup --interactive
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Deletion Policies

Configure deletion behavior:

```yaml
# config.yml
deletion:
  # Require confirmation for all deletions
  require-confirmation: true
  
  # Minimum time before deletion (prevents accidents)
  deletion-delay: 30  # seconds
  
  # Auto-backup before deletion
  auto-backup: true
  
  # Purge configuration entries
  purge-config: true
  
  # Clean up empty groups
  cleanup-empty-groups: true
  
  # Log all deletion operations
  log-deletions: true
```

### Permission-Based Restrictions

Control who can delete worlds:

```yaml
# permissions.yml
permissions:
  lilworlds.world.remove: false          # Basic deletion
  lilworlds.world.remove.force: false    # Force deletion
  lilworlds.world.remove.multiple: false # Bulk deletion
  lilworlds.admin.cleanup: false         # Cleanup operations
```

### Rate Limiting

Prevent deletion abuse:

```yaml
# config.yml
security:
  deletion-rate-limit: 5    # Max 5 deletions per hour
  deletion-cooldown: 300    # 5 minute cooldown between deletions
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Deletion Monitoring

Track deletion activities:

```bash
# View deletion history
/worlds history --deletions

# Monitor deletion statistics
/worlds stats --deletions

# Check recent deletions
/worlds log --filter deletions --recent 24h
```

### Alert System

Configure alerts for important deletions:

```yaml
# config.yml
alerts:
  deletion-alerts: true
  alert-channels:
    - discord
    - console
    - log-file
  
  # Alert for large worlds
  size-threshold: 1GB
  
  # Alert for worlds with many players
  player-threshold: 10
```

## Best Practices

### Before Deletion

<Tip>
**Pre-Deletion Checklist:**
- ✅ Verify you have the correct world name
- ✅ Check if anyone is currently using the world
- ✅ Create a backup if the world might be needed later
- ✅ Inform other admins/players about the deletion
- ✅ Document the reason for deletion
</Tip>

### Deletion Strategy

```yaml
# Recommended deletion workflow
deletion-workflow:
  1. Announce planned deletion to players
  2. Create backup if world has value
  3. Move players out of world
  4. Unload world temporarily to test
  5. Verify no issues with world offline
  6. Proceed with deletion
  7. Monitor for any issues post-deletion
```

### Regular Maintenance

Schedule regular cleanup:

```bash
# Weekly cleanup script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting weekly world cleanup..."

# Remove temporary worlds older than 7 days
/world remove --pattern "temp_*" --older-than 7d

# Clean up orphaned configurations
/worlds cleanup --config

# Remove unused backup worlds
/worlds cleanup --backups --keep 10

echo "Cleanup completed!"
```
